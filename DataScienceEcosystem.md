## Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

In this notebook, Data ScienceTools and Ecosystem are sumarized.

**Objectives:**

List popular languages and libraries for Data Science

Some of popular languages that Data Scientists use are:


```python
>>> languages = ["Julia", "Python", "R"]      # Popular languages in alphabetical order
>>> print(languages)
```

    ['Julia', 'Python', 'R']


Some os the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:


```python
>>> libraries = ["caret", "Pandas", "TensorFlow"]      # Commonly used libraries in alphabetical order
>>> print(libraries)
```

    ['caret', 'Pandas', 'TensorFlow']
